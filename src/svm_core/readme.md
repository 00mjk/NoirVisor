# NoirVisor - SVM Core
This directory is the virtualization engine based on AMD-V. <br>
All code in this directory should be cross-platform designed.

# Files
svm_main.c is the code file that initializes, sets up, and finalizes the virtualization engine based on AMD-V. <br>
svm_exit.c is the code file that handles all the VM-Exits derived from the processor. <br>
svm_def.h defines basic structures for AMD-V, details regarding the VMCB. <br>
svm_exit.h defines defines basic constants, and miscellaneous stuff for VM-Exit. <br>
svm_vmcb.h defines macros for operating the VMCB and offsets of fields in VMCB.

# Features
NoirVisor uses the following AMD-V features:
- MSR Permission Map. This feature enables the stealth MSR-hook for syscall and sysenter hook.
- Address Space Identifier. This is also known as ASID. This feature would tag the TLBs with an ASID so that - on VM-Entry and VM-Exit - processor would not invalidate TLB.

# Stealth MSR-hook Algorithm
This feature utilizes the processor ability to intercept rdmsr instruction. <br>
Set the bit in bitmap to intercept LSTAR or SYSENTER_EIP MSR-read. <br>
On interception, edit the eax and edx register to represent the original value. <br>
Don't forget to set the bit in interception list in VMCB.

# Future Feature (Roadmap)
In future, NoirVisor has following plans:

- Remaster CPUID-caching architecture with flexible design
- Implement SVM-Nesting
- Implement NPT-based Code Integrity Enforcement
- Implement NPT-based Stealth Inline Hook
